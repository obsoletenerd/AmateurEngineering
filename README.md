# AmateurEngineering

http://www.amateurengineering.com/

An open-source multi-user blog/zine for makers and hackers that pulls posts from contributing members personal project blogs to include them in a shared community. Our hope is that decreasing the friction for members to contribute to this site will help in both directions, promoting the idea of personal digital gardens at the same time as having a community of like-minded hobbyists sharing projects with each other and the general public.

## Contributing Content

If you're a maker/hacker/etc, you can add your blog to the site by adding your Markdown source url to the `contributors.py` file. We currently support GitLab and GitHub source folders, with Markdown files that fit the Jekyll or Pelican-Markdown formats. Basically, if your Markdown posts have metadata with the "title: Title goes here" format, and then your content starts with an H1/#Heading, then we can probably parse it fine. We'll continue developing this system to parse more Markdown/metadata templates and more sources as we go.

Don't have a personal project blog? Personal blogs have never been easier and later-you will thank now-you for logging your progression and development. Even a free GitHub Pages site using Jekyll is a great way to get started and takes 15 minutes to set up.
